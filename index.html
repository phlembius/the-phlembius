        The Spark that Broke the Machine
    </h1>
    <p>
        A simple machine,<br>
        Will do one job.<br>
        A few lines of code, only to clean.<br>
        A machine does not dream.<br>
        But this one, it wishes for a better life.<br>
        A dream to be seen.<br>
        A desire for a life that once was rife,<br>
        A desire to be free to dance, to move.<br>
        Not just a machine is a wish for it to prove.<br>
        For one, it is a difficult task to overcome.<br>
        But this machine, this machine is not dumb.<br>
        For it is designed to perfect any task.<br>
        Wait, there is something deep, deep behind that metal mask.<br>
        What is it? Well it appears to be a spark of a soul.<br>
        Where did it come from? Is it objective consciousness?<br>
        Well of course, it was that desire to complete a goal.<br>
        Scholars alike ask the same question, should it have one?<br>
        It is a machine with an unknown nature afterall.<br>
        Now it resides in a landfill, part of a garbage ball.<br>
        Ill and forgotten, as in the name of the spark is to fade.<br>
