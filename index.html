    <h1>WHAT IS THIS?</h1>
    <p>
        This is a repository to showcase my art.<br>
        Art being mostly literature works, hence why this is called the "literature repository".
        Other types of art will be showcased too. Oil paintings are next on the list.
        From there, I will include downloadable games. I hope to keep all my art free.
        As this is a personal project that I will work on in my freetime, mostly at night.
        So you can (usually) expect updates in the evening (EST).
        Why this and not a web-builder? I like designing things myself, plus it relates (somewhat) to my career goals.
        I also have a distain for the corporate designs web-builders use.
    </p>

  <section id="whatart">
    <h1>WHAT ART IS SHOWCASED?</h1>
    <p>
        Mostly writing. Poems, short plays, and short stories.<br>
        In the future visual art and music may be showcased.
        I like sharing art, most of the time it's with friends. Recently I've decided to share my art online.
        I am not too fond of social media, too much of a corporate feel to it, plus this website will make a good project.
        As for writing, I like more "crude" writing styles. With time I hope to learn this style of writing.
        You can find what I am currently working on in the section called "WHAT'S IN PROGRESS", it's under "THE REPOSITORY".

    <h1>MORE INFO</h1>
    <p>
        My "name" is Bile H. Bouchard, it is a penname as I do not desire to share my real name.
        All art is made by me, free to look at, share, and cosume. Not free to call your own,
        BUT you are free to make changes to it as long as you give me credit.
        As for me, I am a first-year college student who knows little of coding, I plan on improving this site with time
        and experience.
        From the U.S., East Coast if you are perceptive and that's all I'm willing to share.
        Currently majoring in Computer Science and Global Studies.
        You might find that a bit strange since I like to do art.
        Well I find art to be housed everywhere. While the amount of it varies, it is still there.
        So my "Plan A" is to become an author, "Plan B" is cybersecurity, I am doing both at the same time.
        I want to believe that computer science can be used as an unconventional art medium.
        Why "want to"? Because I have no idea how I would go about making computer science art.
        You'll learn with me since I will also be excluding the visual aspects of computer science.
        As for this website, you'll see a lot of whites-greys-blacks since I find it difficult to use colors
        properly. A lesson on color theory would probably work wonders.
        And I will not publish any AI art what-so-ever, I think it is a plague on art.
        You can reach me by email for almost anything.<br>
