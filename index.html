    <h1>WHAT IS THIS?</h1>
    <p>
        This is a repository to showcase my art.<br>
       Art being mostly literature works, hence why this is called the "literature repository".<br>
       Other types of art will be showcased too. Oil paintings are next on the list.<br>
       From there, I will include downloadable games. I hope to keep this free.<br>
       As this is a personal project that I will work on in my freetime, mostly at night.<br>
       So expect updates in the evening, EST.<br>
       Why this and not a web-builder? More details can be found in "ARTIST INFO" but I like
       doing things myself.<br>
       I also have a distain for the corporate designs web-builders use.<br>

  <section id="whatart">
    <h1>WHAT ART IS SHOWCASED?</h1>
    <p>
        Mostly writing. Poems, short plays, and short stories. In the future visual art and music may be showcased.<br>
       I like sharing art, most of the time it's with friends. Recently I've decided to share my art online.<br>
       I am not too fond of social media, and as you get to know me, this website will make a good project.<br>
       As for writing, I like more "crude" writing styles. With time I hope to learn this style of writing.<br> 
    </p>

    <h1>MORE INFO</h1>
    <p>
        My "name" is Bile H. Bouchard, it is a penname as I do not desire to share my real name.<br>
        All art is made by me, free to look at, share, and cosume. Not free to call your own.<br>
        I am a first-year college student who knows little of coding, I plan on improving this site with time
        and experience.<br>
        From the U.S., that's all you need to know. East Coast if you are perceptive.<br>
        Majoring in Computer Science and Global Studies.<br>
        I find art to be housed everywhere. While the amount of it varies, it is still there.<br> 
        I believe computer science can be used as an unconventional art medium.<br>
        How will I do this? You'll have to learn with me since I have no concept of how computer art will function,
        excluding visual aspects.<br>
        As for this website, you'll see a lot of whites-greys-blacks since I find it difficult to use colors
        properly.<br>
        You can reach me by email for most things, bilehbouchard@thephlembius.com
